This is an asp.net core MVC project
I used the tutorial from microsoft.com as template.
There are 5 main folders
1. Data - would either connect to a local sql server database, or write my own CSV parser to parse Mobile_Food_Facility_Permit.csv and load into memory
2. Models - Food truck definition etc.
3. Controllers
4. Views - rendering 
5. Test - unit test folder
